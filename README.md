# Ring Notify

> Update (04 Feb 2026): This project is archived. The core dependency, [react-native-callkeep](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-callkeep), appears to be unmaintained. Because it enables the key feature of this app, continuing development isn’t feasible unless a new CallKeep-style library is built or the app is rewritten as fully native.

> An alternative, [react-native-incomingcall](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rentlydev/react-native-incomingcall), offers similar functionality but currently supports Android only. Since [react-native-callkeep](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-callkeep) is unmaintained, I can’t upgrade to a newer Expo version, so I’m stopping development.
